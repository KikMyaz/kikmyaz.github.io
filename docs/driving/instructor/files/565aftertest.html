		Now That You've Passed</div>
	<div class="content">
		<div class="line"></div><div class="content"><br></div><div class="content"><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">So now that you've passed your test, first of all, well done! &nbsp;After all of that hard work, you're now a qualified driver! For some of you, this may help you travel to and from work, may even mean greater job prospects. For some, driving may help with child care or enable easier contact with friends or family.&nbsp;</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content" style="line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Being able to drive can have many benefits, not least to offer you a great sense of freedom. But driving also carries a huge responsibility for you. Consider these statistics:</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3">&nbsp;</font></div><div class="content"><ul><li><font color="#000000" face="arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style="line-height: 16px;">One in five new drivers has a crash within six months of passing their test</span></font></li><li><font color="#000000" face="arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style="line-height: 16px;">An 18 year old driver is more than three times more likely to be involved in a crash than a 48 year old</span></font></li><li><font color="#000000" face="arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style="line-height: 16px;">Older drivers more frequently fail to look properly while younger ones are more likely to be going too fast</span></font></li><li><font color="#000000" face="arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><span style="line-height: 16px;">You're four times more likely to crash if you use a mobile phone whilst driving</span></font></li></ul></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content" style="line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Please don't let these sobering statistics spoil the afterglow of your great result but do please give them some thought. You have gained many &nbsp;skills which will help you become a safe driver but you are still at the beginning of a long learning curve. You are about to begin driving without your instructor, without advice and guidance constantly at hand. It is possible that you may make some mistakes - so why not use a green P plate for a while? This will inform &nbsp;other road users that you’ve just passed and will warn them to give you more consideration.</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content" style="line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Speak to your instructor about taking the Pass Plus course. The Pass Plus section of this app provides lots of the kind of content you might practice, concentrating on areas of driving in which you have had little practice, be they rural roads, night driving and of course a very valuable lesson on motorways.</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content" style="line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">You will be faced with new distractions. Passengers need to respect your particular need for extra concentration. Be prepared, for example, &nbsp;to shut down any unnecessary conversation whilst you deal with tricky situations; even experienced drivers will do this. And be very strict with yourself about not using &nbsp;your mobile phone whilst driving. It may be a big temptation but make it your policy to text or call before you set off, then put your phone onto ‘silent’ and ensure that it is out of the way.</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content" style="line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Most drivers respect the speed limits, so make sure that you do too. Remember, however, that most speed related accidents occur within the speed limits, illustrating how much discretion is required to deal with the massive variety of road layouts and conditions which you will encounter now that you have passed the test.</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content"><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">Drive well within the limits of your cars control. Even if you feel very confident, you don’t know where those limits are, not until you’ve crossed them, and by then it could be too late. If you’re interested, take an advanced driving course on a race track and avoid becoming any part of a future tragedy on the road!</font></div><div class="content"><font size="3"><br></font></div><div class="content"><font size="3">So off you go, out onto the open road! Be safe and please enjoy many happy years of driving..&nbsp;</font></div>
