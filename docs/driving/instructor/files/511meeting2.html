			<p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 21px; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">It is common to encounter obstructions in the road, be they parked cars, skips or roadworks. The road may then become too narrow for two vehicles to pass each other. Look ahead and assess the situation early</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Recognise the general rule of priority. If the obstruction is on your side of the road, you should allow priority to the oncoming vehicle. However, don't assume this order and be prepared to give way whenever necessary.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">If obstructions are on both sides of the road, nobody has priority. See below (2) for how to proceed.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Waiting vehicles may flash their headlights to encourage you to proceed. The official meaning of flashed headlights, is an alert of ones presence so never assume that it is a sign to go. However, it is practical to respond if you’re confident the flash was intended for your benefit. Be sure to check it is safe before proceeding.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; "><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">If it is safe to, allow priority to vehicles coming up steep hills, even if it is their side of the road which is obstructed. It is much harder to stop and start going uphill than down, especially for large vehicles.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; "><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">Be careful of following traffic which may mistake you for a parked car when you’re waiting. Always check your mirrors and consider a signal when setting off again.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">Where the road is particularly narrow and you are forced to pass through a tight gap, slow the car down accordingly. The smaller the gap, the lower the speed should be.</font></p>

			<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Look out for dangers, like pedestrians stepping out from between parked vehicles, doors opening, vehicles pulling away and obscured side roads. Take extra care and slow down where necessary.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18.6667px;"><b><font size="4">1.Obstructions On One Side</font></b></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18.6667px; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Because the obstruction is on its&nbsp; side of the road, the red car should &nbsp;allow priority to the green one.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18.6667px;"><font size="3" style="line-height: 20px;">In this scenario, the red car waits in a gap between the parked cars. Notice the position it’s taken, and how it steered there. Crucially, it has stopped no closer than a car length from the parked car in front and has already begun to steer back out. This enables the driver to get around easily when the opportunity arises and it also distinguishes them from the parked cars.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18.6667px; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">The green car recognises its priority on the approach but proceeds carefully.</font></p><p style="font-size: 12px;"><img src="meetingnew1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%"><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><b style="font-size: 14pt;"><font size="4">2.Obstructions On Both Sides</font></b><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">The purple and the red car have no priority over each other because obstructions are on both sides of the road. It is therefore up to both drivers to look for a place to wait.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">In this case, the red car takes a waiting position as the purple one proceeds, driving very carefully in case of hidden dangers.&nbsp;</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">A polite wave of gratitude as the vehicles pass each other is normal.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; "><b style=""><font size="4">3.Meeting On Wider Roads</font></b></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Though there are parked cars here, there is enough space for two vehicles to pass each other safely. The red car, driving slightly over the centre line, establishes this position early so that the oncoming orange car has time to respond.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">The orange car, looking well up the road, recognises the situation and moves left a little, carefully driving closer to the kerb than usual.</font></p><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Where the space is reduced, both drivers should slow down.</font></p><p style="font-size: 12px;"><img src="meetingnew2.jpg" style="max-width: 100%"><br></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18.6667px;"><b><font size="4">4.Planning</font></b></p><p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 18.6667px; line-height: 20px;"><font size="3">Plan carefully to avoid congestion on narrow roads. Don't follow a vehicle into a narrow space without being able to see for yourself that the road ahead is clear.</font></p>
